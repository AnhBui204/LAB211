as you can see,  it is possible to determine whether a string is normalized very quickly. Initializing buffers accounts for a significant portion of the normalization cost in the "second row." Its expense is spread out over longer string processing times.

 it turns out that we seldom use these buffers,   so  we may modify the approach in the future to expedite the typical situation for short strings even more.
